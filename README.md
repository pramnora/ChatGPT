I went and joined...
- https://www.openai.com
...in order to test out using the 'latest' AI-Artificial Intelligence program called: ChatGPT.

I heard that the bot is trained on 'billions' of lines of code...so, I just wanted to find out if what they are saying is true.  

Apparently, you merely state what sort of program code it is you want...;   
and, the bot, quite simply, spouts out that code...as easy and straight forwards as that...?!  

Well, very much to my own surprise -(you never really know until you've gone and done it yourself)-;   
everything they said 'is' true. 

The first thing I told it was to create a 12 x Tables program using QBASIC;     
and, sure enough, the code it automatically spat out was both 'copy and paste' runnable...; with code syntax all correct.
