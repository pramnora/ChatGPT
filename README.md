I went and joined...
- https://www.openai.com  
...in order to test out using the 'latest' AI-Artificial Intelligence program called: ChatGPT.

I heard that the bot is trained on 'billions' of lines of code...;    
so, I just wanted to find out if all that they are saying about it is true...;  
that even people who are 'non programmers' can use it to create effective programs for themselves.    

Apparently, you merely state what sort of program code it is you want...;   
and, the bot, quite simply, spouts out that code...as easy and straight forwards as that...?!  

Well, very much to my own surprise -(you never really know until you've gone and done it yourself)-;   
everything they said 'is' true. 

The first thing I told it was to create a 12 x Tables program using QBASIC;     
and, sure enough, the code it automatically spat out was both 'copy and paste' runnable...;   
with code syntax all correct.  

Wow! It really would appear that us 'programmers' are no longer needed, anymore;    
as even a 'non-programmer' can make a request to an AI bot...;  
- create a HTML web page  
- create a QBASIC program  
- etc.  
...and, immediately, straight away...the bot will simply do all of the coding for you;    
all you as the AI user needs to do is to merely 'copy and paste'...then, hit run...and, all done/finished!
